 The PostgreSQL database instance may take several minutes to provision. In order to connect to the DB instance and start using it in subsequent labs, you need to retrieve the DB instance endpoint.

The **Endpoint & port** section in the **Connectivity and security** tab of the details page displays the endpoint. Note this value down, as you will use them later.
