[PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/what-is-postgresql/) has become the preferred [open source](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/open-source-databases/) relational database for many enterprise developers and startups, powering leading business and mobile applications. Amazon RDS makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale PostgreSQL deployments on the cloud. With Amazon RDS, you can deploy scalable PostgreSQL deployments in minutes with cost-efficient and resizable hardware capacity. Amazon RDS manages complex and time-consuming administrative tasks such as PostgreSQL software installation and upgrades, storage management, replication for high availability and read throughput, and backups for disaster recovery.

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL gives you access to the capabilities of the familiar PostgreSQL database engine. This means that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases can be used with Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL currently supports PostgreSQL 9.6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. With [Trusted Language Extensions (TLE) for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/features/), you can build high performance extensions and safely run them on Amazon RDS using popular trusted languages without needing AWS to certify code.

By using AWS RDS PostgreSQL, you will get the following benefit below:
- Easier, managed deployments
- Fast, predictable storage
- Backup and recovery
- High availability and read replicas
- Monitoring and metrics 
- Isolation and security
