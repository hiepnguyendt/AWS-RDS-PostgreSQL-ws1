After Amazon RDS provisions your DB instance, you can use any standard SQL client application to connect to the instance. In this workshop, we have two ways to connect to **RDS PostgreSQL AWS**
- Using **pgAdmin4** to connect
- Using **psql** to connect

### This lab contains following tasks:

 1. [Using pgAdmin4 to connect to RDS PostgreSQL](4-1-usingpgadmin4/)
 2. [Using psql to connect to RDS PostgreSQL](4-2-usingpsql/)
 3. [Querying data](4-3-queryingdata/)
