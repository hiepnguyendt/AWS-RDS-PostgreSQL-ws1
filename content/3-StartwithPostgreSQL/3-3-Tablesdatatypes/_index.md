**What is a Table and why do I see PostgreSQL sometimes call them Relations ?**\
From the **PostgreSQL documentation** ,

> "PostgreSQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS). That means it is a system for managing data stored in relations. Relation is essentially a mathematical term for table. The notion of storing data in tables is so commonplace today that it might seem inherently obvious, but there are a number of other ways of organizing databases. Files and directories on Unix-like operating systems form an example of a hierarchical database. A more modern development is the object-oriented database.
>
> Each table is a named collection of rows. Each row of a given table has the same set of named columns, and each column is of a specific data type. Whereas columns have a fixed order in each row, it is important to remember that SQL does not guarantee the order of the rows within the table in any way (although they can be explicitly sorted for display).
>
> Tables are grouped into databases, and a collection of databases managed by a single PostgreSQL server instance constitutes a database cluster."
 
 #### Explore Tables

 1.In your pgAdmin tool, expand your **first_schema** inside your **first_database**.

 2.Right-click on **Tables** and choose **Create** then select **Table**

 ![create table](/images/2/2-3/12.png)

 3.Name your table **`first_table`**.

  ![named table](/images/2/2-3/13.png)

 There is an option to make your table partitioned. For this **first_table**, we will not use table partitioning.

 {{% notice info %}}
 Table Partitioning in PostgreSQL is an interesting subject. It is interesting because table partitioning has evolved across the PostgreSQL versions. In earlier versions (version 9 and earlier), table partitioning was indirectly supported via the PostgreSQL table inheritance feature (see below). Starting with PostgreSQL version 10, table partition became a native declarative feature. A key thing to remember is that the exact set of table partitioning features supported are tied to the PostgreSQL version. So, be sure you refer to the [table partitioning documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/ddl-partitioning.html)  tied to the version of PostgreSQL you are using.

 4.Click on Columns to advance to the Columns tab. Then click on the **+** sign. Then enter `col1` for the Name. Fill out `text` for the Data type. Click Yes for Not NULL. Click Yes for Primary Key.

 There is an option to inherit columns from other tables. We will not use table inheritance for this first_table, but it is an interesting and useful PostgreSQL capability to be aware of.

 {{% notice info %}}
 Table Inheritance in PostgreSQL can be a useful tool for database designers. Table inheritance lets a child table inherit all of the columns of its parent table(s). Further, you can write queries against parent tables that reference the rows of the parent table and all of its descendent tables, too. See the example in the [table inheritance documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/ddl-inherit.html)  to better understand the capabilities.

 5.Browse the available options on the other tabs and end up on the SQL tab. Then click Save.

#### Explore Data types

As discussed in the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/ddl-basics.html) ,

"PostgreSQL includes a sizable set of built-in data types that fit many applications. Users can also define their own data types. Most built-in data types have obvious names and semantics, so we defer a detailed explanation to Chapter 8. Some of the frequently used data types are ``integer`` for whole numbers, ``numeric`` for possibly fractional numbers, ``text`` for character strings, ``date`` for dates, ``time`` for time-of-day values, and ``timestamp`` for values containing both date and time."

{{%expand "1. Numbers" %}}
You can read more about PostgreSQL number data types [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/datatype-numeric.html) . Here are few quotes from the documentation:

 The type ``integer`` is the common choice [for whole numbers], as it offers the best balance between range, storage size, and performance.
 
 The type ``numeric`` can store numbers with a very large number of digits. It is especially recommended for storing monetary amounts and other quantities where exactness is required. Calculations with numeric values yield exact results where possible, e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication. However, calculations on numeric values are very slow compared to the integer types, or to the floating-point types [``real`` and ``double precision``].

 The data types ``smallserial``, ``serial`` and ``bigserial`` are not true types, but merely a notational convenience for creating unique identifier columns (similar to the AUTO_INCREMENT property supported by some other databases).

{{%expand "2. Character" %}}
You can read more about PostgreSQL character data types [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/datatype-character.html) . Here are few quotes from the documentation:

SQL defines two primary character types: ``character varying(n)`` and ``character(n)``, where n is a positive integer. Both of these types can store strings up to n characters (not bytes) in length. ... If the string to be stored is shorter than the declared length, values of type ``character(n)`` will be space-padded.

The notations ``varchar(n)`` and ``char(n)`` are aliases for ``character varying(n)`` and ``character(n)``, respectively.

In addition, PostgreSQL provides the ``text`` type, which stores strings of any length.

There is no performance difference among these three types, apart from increased storage space when using the blank-padded type, and a few extra CPU cycles to check the length when storing into a length-constrained column. While ``character(n)`` has performance advantages in some other database systems, there is no such advantage in PostgreSQL; in fact ``character(n)`` is usually the slowest of the three because of its additional storage costs. In most situations ``text`` or ``character varying`` should be used instead.

{{%expand "3. Dates and Times" %}}
You can read more about PostgreSQL date and time data types [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/datatype-datetime.html) .

PostgreSQL supports ``date``, ``time``, and ``timestamp`` datatypes. The ``time`` and ``timestamp`` datatypes can be with or without a timezone. The default is without a timezone. The ``timestampz`` datatype is an alias for a ``timestamp with time zone``. The ``time`` and ``timestamp`` datatypes can also be specified with a precision of 0-6 digits of resolution for the seconds. The maximum precision is 1 microsecond.

{{% notice note %}}
It should be noted that Oracle's date datatype is different than the PostgreSQL date datatype. An Oracle date is most equivalent to the PostgreSQL ``timestamp(0)`` datatype.

{{%expand "4. Other datatypes" %}}
You can read more about all of the PostgreSQL data types [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/datatype.html) .

PostgreSQL has a very rich and extensible set of data types. For example, PostgreSQL has a useful set of [JSON-specific datatypes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/datatype-json.html)  ``json`` and ``jsonb``.
